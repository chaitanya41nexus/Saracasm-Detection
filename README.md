# Saracasm-Detection
## IST 664 course project.
This is a course project for IST 664 Natural Language Processing.

My goal was to work on a sarcasm and humor detection script allowing me to acquire a huge amount of tweets and filter out the ones that were sarcastic and again feed the data into the training models to make the detection even stronger. End goal of the project was to detect sarcastic tweets with supervised training models.

In this project, I did the following:
- Acquired and filtered twitter data using its developer API and in-built classification tool to label them. 
- Performed tokenization and classification to preprocess the data to make it ready for modeling. 
- Used bag of word to understand initial feature sets required for predicting sarcastic statements and phrases. 
- Utilized different feature sets such as unigrams/bigrams, POS tagging to improve initial accuracy. 
- Implemented Na√Øve Bayes Classifier with conditional probabilities to predict sarcastic features.
